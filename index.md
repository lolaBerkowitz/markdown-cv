## Currently

Examining attractor dynamics of head direction cells in the TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer's disease.

### Research interests

My broad research interests surround the ability of animals to spatially orient within an environment. What fascinates me most about spatial orientation is how internally generated senses, such as self-motion or head direction, interact with external sensory inputs, such as vision, to create stable representations of orientation within an environment. I use both detailed behavioral analysis and in-vivo electrophysiological techniques to answer questions relating to 1.) How animals interact with prominant environemntal cues during spatial navigation or exploration and 2.) How the firing dynamics of populations of neurons change as a function of environment. Additionally, I am also investigating how neual systems associated with spatial orientation break down in Alzheimer's disease. My disseration work aims to describe the functional consequences of Alzheimer's disease pathology on the attractor dynamics in the TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
